# Investigating representation schemes for surrogate modeling of High Entropy Alloys

by Arindam Debnath, Wesley F. Reinhart.

This repository is the official implementation of [Investigating representation schemes for surrogate modeling of High Entropy Alloys](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00179.pdf), which has been submitted for publication in *Computational Materials Science*.

In this paper, we have systematically compared several representation schemes for atomic fractions of alloys on the basis of their performance in single-task deep learning models and in transfer learning scenarios.
